# Phonebook

<p>

Basic phonebook web application given as a task from SoftUni in Java Fundamentals Module.</br>


1. The application runs on Java 18.
2. In order to start it, first you need to set the version of the SDK to 18 in the project settings of your IDE.</br>
3. The version of the SDK is also specified in the pom.xml file.</br>

</p>

### UPDATE:</br>

I have made changes to the "skeleton" of the application 

**The changes are as follows:**
1. I made some changes to the application that includes:
   * Changed the "``Name``" field to "``First Name``".
   * Added new field "``Last Name``".
   * Added new field "``Company``".
   * Added new field "``Email``".
   * Added new field "``Age``".
2. Added the new values to the constructor and created new java classes used for DB connection and adding DB entries.
3. Created method for adding new contact to the DB, if all the fields are filled.
4. I used the same DB as of my previous project: [ContactsBook-DB](https://github.com/NMKrastev/ContactsBook-DB). You can use this project as reference on how to configure the table in your DB.

* Note: Feel free to make any changes to the application!
